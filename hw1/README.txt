In our simulations, we have used python3.10 to run the code.
The pytho file names follow the following convention: "partx_y.py", in which x is the number of the part, and y is the
subsection of part x. For example, "part2_b.py" is the answer code for part2, subsection b.
If the part does not have a subsection, the following converntion is used: "partx.py".
